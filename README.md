# netmovers-honeypot

**netmovers-honeypot** is a web-based honeypot infrastructure simulating a logistics company to attract cyberattacks for research and analysis. The project consists of both front-end and back-end components designed to collect and analyze data from malicious activities targeting the infrastructure.

## Project Overview
This honeypot mimics a real-world logistics company, **NetMovers**, with a fully functional web interface and backend services. The goal is to attract attackers and log their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Insights gained from these attacks will be used to improve cybersecurity measures and develop defense strategies.

## Features
- **Front-End**: A realistic web interface that simulates a logistics company, including forms and file upload functionality.
- **Back-End**: APIs to handle user requests, store data, and enable interaction with a fake database.
- **Data Collection**: Captures and logs attack vectors, allowing for detailed analysis.
- **File Upload Route**: Allows attackers to upload malicious files, which are safely collected for analysis.
